# TO-DO
- Change CVS to CWE with a custom score based by Aster calculated with the CVSS V4.0
- A brand new remediation schema with brand new priorities based on professional advice. 
- Add the new scripts that enable remediation via Microsoft Graph and the other endpoints
- Add the posibility for 1-click remediation as you execute the PowerShell command via the browser
- Take the Exception part into a core module to eliminate the stuff out of the Powershell script
- Migrate all the Information parts to a different powershell script
- Impact will be removed / redefined based on the remediation and not on the risk
- Risk will be based on the CWE and calculated by Aster in combination with the CVSS and a (generic) Risk-Analysis method
- RemediationScript will be added in the object
- Directory will be created earlier to get the new path name so the logfiles will be stored in the correct folder and pointed to the correct folder
- We are seperating some functions as they are serving as a core module in the future which will be a seperate .ps1 file for better managability
- Powershell 7 Compatibility
- Make a risk distribution Chart en make the other chart responsive instead of a static chart
- Every check will be required to give some output (if something is found of course!) and save this to the findings folder within the reports folder
- We are looking to implement NIST or another framework as well in the future
- Testing a network connection script that allows only this scrip to be run when user is actually online. Get-NetRoute | ? DestinationPrefix -eq '0.0.0.0/0' | Get-NetIPInterface | Where ConnectionState -eq 'Connected' (Which is for checking Network Connection)
- Fully cross-platform compatibility by removing as many platform dependencies and replacing them by initiating them via API connections.
