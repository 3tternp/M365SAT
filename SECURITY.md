Me as a Vulnerability Assessor take security very seriously. Take in mind that this program can execute other inspector modules. That means even malicious scripts can be ran if wanted. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of files if that is the case.

Please use the security best-practices as followed:
- Use least privilege on the account you audit with. So only the necessary privileges for the audit being used on the account you are provided with,
- Write-Protect the inspector folder for unauthorized access to make sure your inspectors are not being overwritten with malicious code,
- Do not place, unless it is trusted, any PowerShell script into the inspectors folder
- Do not download M365SAT from external websites, as they might have malicious stuff with them injected into the scripts. Only download M365SAT from my GitHub page.
- If you have bought this software from someone, immediately ask for a refund as this software is free-of-charge
